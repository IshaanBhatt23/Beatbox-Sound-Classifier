# Beatbox-Sound-Classifier
Developed a sequential model using Numpy, Librosa, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn and Sounddevice to classify beatbox sounds with 72% accuracy.
Since no publicly available dataset for beatbox sound classification currently exists, I created a custom dataset from scratch. It includes audio samples categorized into four classes: kick, hi-hats, snare, and clops. Each class contains multiple labeled samples recorded manually to support training and testing of my model.
